Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on my mind, I thought I would walk about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the town. It is a way I have of driving off the
locals and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the time;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my house; whenever I find myself involuntarily
standing before coffin door, and bringing up the rear of every person I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately crawling into the hole, and methodically
mess people's thoughts off—then, I account it high time to get to Europe as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all students in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the school with me.
